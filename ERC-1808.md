## Simple Summary

@TODO

## Abstract

   ERC-1808 Standard (hereinafter referred to as "1808 Standard") is a non-homogeneous digital assets standard that applied to decentralized distributed ledger network. As the perfect way to represent various non-fungible items, non-homogeneous digital assets can cover the field of game items, gears, characters, map data, and even expansion pack in the game industry. This manual also focus on the multiverse system based on 1808 Standard, such as universe traveling, multiverse, and etc.  
   
## Motivation

A standard interface allows wallet/broker/auction applications to work with any NFT on Ethereum. We provide for simple ERC-1808 smart contracts as well as contracts that track an *arbitrarily large* number of NFTs. Additional applications are discussed below.

This standard is inspired by the ERC-20 token standard and builds on two years of experience since EIP-20 was created. EIP-20 is insufficient for tracking NFTs because each asset is distinct (non-fungible) whereas each of a quantity of tokens is identical (fungible).

Differences between this standard and EIP-20 are examined below.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

**Every ERC-1808 compliant contract must implement the `ERC1808` and `ERC165` interfaces** (subject to "caveats" below):

## Rationale

## Backwards Compatibility

We have adopted `balanceOf`, `totalSupply`, `name` and `symbol` semantics from the ERC-20 specification. An implementation may also include a function `decimals` that returns `uint8(0)` if its goal is to be more compatible with ERC-20 while supporting this standard. However, we find it contrived to require all ERC-1808 implementations to support the `decimals` function.

## Test Cases

ERC-1808 Token includes test cases written using Truffle.
